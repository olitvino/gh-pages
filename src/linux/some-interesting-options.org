* Hide processes running as other users

The proc filesystem supports the following mount option =hidepid=

0   Everybody  may access all /proc/[pid] directories.  This is the traditional behavior, and the default if this mount option is not specified.
1   Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any /proc/[pid]  directories  but  their  own  (the /proc/[pid]  directories  themselves  remain  visible)
2   As for mode 1, but in addition the /proc/[pid] directories belonging to other  users  become  invisible.


#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mount -o remount,rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=2 /proc
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC /etc/fstab
proc    /proc    proc    defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,hidepid=2     0     0
#+END_SRC

* Disable reading kernel message buffer for unprivileged users

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sysctl -w kernel.dmesg_restrict=1
#+END_SRC
